>  This repository performs segmentation of convex patches and detection of edges based on the input elevation map: [https://github.com/ori-drs/plane_seg](https://github.com/ori-drs/plane_seg)

## Jet-Leg

>  This is an open-source python package that shows how to compute the feasible region, i.e. the extension of the well known support region to include joint-torque limits constraints of legged robots: [https://github.com/orsoromeo/jet-leg](https://github.com/orsoromeo/jet-leg)

## Locomotion-Viewer

>  a Rviz tool for visualizing locomotion-related geometric objects such as waypoint markers, trajectories, 2D support regions and 3D feasibility constraints: [https://github.com/iit-DLSLab/locomotion-viewer/](https://github.com/iit-DLSLab/locomotion-viewer)
