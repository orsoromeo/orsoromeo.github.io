After completing my Bsc. in Mechanical Engineering in 2013 and my Msc. in Robotics Engineering in 2015 at the University of Genova, I then joined the [Dynamic Legged Systems](https://dls.iit.it/) (DLS) team at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) as PhD student on motion planning for quadruped robots.
After defending my PhD thesis in Feb. 2019, I then remained as a post doctoral researcher in the DLS team until September 2019.

From October 2019 until December 2020 I have been a post doctoral researcher at the [Dynamic Robot Systems](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/drs/) (DRS) team of the Oxford Robotics Institute (ORI), University of Oxford, working with Dr. Maurice Fallon. My research in the lab focuses on dynamic and perceptive locomotion for legged robots.
My research interests focused on motion planning, optimal control, online/real-time model predictive control and reinforcement learning for robotic legged locomotion.

In December 2020 I decided to move to the industry I have joined [Arrival Ltd](https://arrival.com/uk/en) as a Robotics Research Engineer, where I worked on R&D projects included within the concept of microfactory and on the automation of EV-production.

Since September 2023 I have moved on to [Ocado Technology](https://www.ocadogroup.com/), where I am currently working as a Robotics Research Engineer on three different Horizon Europe (HE) projects related to manipulation and grasping of soft and deformable objects. Here are more details:
- [IntelliMan](https://intelliman-project.eu/)
- [SoftEnable](https://softenable.eu/)
- [SestoSenso](http://sestosenso.eu/)
