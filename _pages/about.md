After completing my Bsc. in Mechanical Engineering in 2013 and my Msc. in Robotics Engineering in 2015 at the University of Genova, I then joined the Dynamic Legged Systems (DLS) team at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) as PhD student on motion planning for quadruped robots.
After defending my PhD thesis in Feb. 2019, I then remained as a post doctoral researcher in the DLS team until September 2019.

Since October 2019, I am a post doctoral researcher at the Dynamic Robot Systems (DRS) team of the Oxford Robotics Institute (ORI), University of Oxford, working with Dr. Maurice Fallon. My research in the lab focuses on dynamic and perceptive locomotion for legged robots.
My research interests encompass motion planning, optimal control, model predictive control and reinforcement learning.
