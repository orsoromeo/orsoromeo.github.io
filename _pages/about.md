Michele Focchi is currently a Researcher at the Advanced Robotics department, 
Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia. He received both the B.Sc. and the M.Sc. 
in Control System Engineering from Politecnico di Milano.
Until 2009 he worked for the R\&D department of Indesit company in the field of house appliances. 
In 2009 he started to develop a prototype of a novel concept of air-pressure driven micro-turbine for power generation for which he obtained an international patent and several awards. In 2013, he got a
Ph.D. degree in robotics, getting involved in the Hydraulically Actuated Quadruped Robot 
project. He initially was developing low-level controllers for locomotion purposes, subsequently he moved to higher level (whole-body) controllers and model identification. During many years he was investigating 
locomotion strategies  that are robust to uncertainties an work reliably on the real platform. 
Currently his research interests are focused on pushing the performances of  quadruped robots  in traversing unstructured environments, by using    optimization-based planning strategies.
