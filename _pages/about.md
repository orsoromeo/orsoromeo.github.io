After completing my Bsc. in Mechanical Engineering in 2013 and my Msc. in Robotics Engineering in 2015 at the University of Genova, I then joined the [Dynamic Legged Systems](https://dls.iit.it/) (DLS) team at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) as PhD student on motion planning for quadruped robots.
After defending my PhD thesis in Feb. 2019, I then remained as a post doctoral researcher in the DLS team until September 2019.

Since October 2019 until December 2020 I have been a post doctoral researcher at the [Dynamic Robot Systems](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/drs/) (DRS) team of the Oxford Robotics Institute (ORI), University of Oxford, working with Dr. Maurice Fallon. My research in the lab focuses on dynamic and perceptive locomotion for legged robots.
My research interests focused on motion planning, optimal control, online/real-time model predictive control and reinforcement learning for robotic legged locomotion.

Since December 2020 until October 2022 I have worked as a Robotics Research Engineer at [Arrival Ltd](https://arrival.com/uk/en), working on R&D projects within the concept of microfactory and on the automation of EV-production.

Since November 2022 I have now moved on to bp, where I am currently exploring nascent robotics applications that might potentially disrupt the energy industry. In particular, I am acting as an advisor to the [Digital Science](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/news-and-insights/reimagining-energy/robotics-at-bp.html) team, to help bp achieve their ambitious goal to produce energy in a sustainable way, with the final target to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
